 # Ascension Perks
 ap_guardian_ai:0 "The Guardian"
 ap_guardian_ai_desc:0 "By combining bio-nanotechnology remotely with a single, central artificial intelligence, we will never be alone, never be sick, we will recover rapidly from the severest of injuries, will survive longer without sustenance or sleep, have instant access to everything we know and will never die of old age."
 ap_luminous_beings_are_we:0 "Luminous Beings Are We"
 ap_luminous_beings_are_we_desc:0 "There is a growing number amongst our people who have an awareness of a universal force, or \"Weave\", that binds us all. They have an inherent understanding that all matter and energy is connected by it, and an ability to manipulate it, some to benefit others, some purely for selfish gain. These gifted \"Weavers\", as they have come to be called, will need guidance and a purpose, and some of the more dangerous ones may need to be controlled."
