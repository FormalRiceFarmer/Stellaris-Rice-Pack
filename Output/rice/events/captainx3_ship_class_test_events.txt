# This is meant as a test event (checking changes/bugs) for NSC devs to gain certain techs without others for testing/bug hunting purposes.

# This listing is of each ID and what it does for ease of reference in-game:
# Type into the Console: event [eventname]. Below are all event names and their purpose.
#
# nsc_test.1  = Gives all technology for all ship/station classes
# nsc_test.2  = Gives all technology for all ship/station classes & gives one tech per reserachable weaponry type (PD/T/XL)
# nsc_test.3  = Gives all ship class technology
# nsc_test.4  = Gives Military Station technology (3 Vanilla, Battle Fortress, HQ Station)
# nsc_test.5  = Gives NSC stations non-military (Sensor/Mining/Power Stations)
# nsc_test.6  = Gives Science/Construction Cruiser
# nsc_test.7  = Gives 1 of each researchable weapon type (PD/T/XL)
# nsc_test.8  = Gives PD Weapon Type
# nsc_test.9  = Gives T Weapon Type
# nsc_test.10 = Gives XL Weapon Type
# nsc_test.11 = Gives Frontier Outpost Tier Techs
# nsc_test.12a= Gives Flagship & HQ Station only (techs with factor = 0)
# nsc_test.13 = Gives Flagship & HQ Station only (IF the player has Superdreadnought and Battle Fortress techs)
# nsc_test.14 = Gives all ACT techs
# nsc_test.15 = Gives all Special Component techs
